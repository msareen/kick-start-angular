# kick-start-angular
A quick start template for my mean stack projects.

<h2>kick-start-angular</h2>

<h4>Why I am wasting my time here</h4>
<p>This is my own implementation of mean stack to quick start angular projects. I liked mean.io concept but they seems like to opinionated </p>
<p>Being opiniated is not a bad thing, but its hides too much implementation details and when the project has some critical bugs it is hard to get them resolved</p>
